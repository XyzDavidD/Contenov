                  <p>
                    &ldquo;Some while ago, I worked with a business that was generating blogs, and I had to upload them to the website. Before uploading them, there was a very long period of time I had to wait while the content strategist and writer were creating the blog.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                    This delay was frustrating for everyone involved. The business could have published way more blogs and reached a much bigger audience. They were literally leaving money on the table because of how slow the process was.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                    That&apos;s when I realized there had to be a better way. If we had a tool like Contenov back then, the entire process could have been much easier and more efficient.&rdquo;
                  </p>
                  
                  <p className="font-semibold text-secondary">
                    So I built Contenov to solve this exact problem - making content brief creation fast, efficient, and accessible to everyone.

                Great content drives business growth, but the research and planning process is broken.
